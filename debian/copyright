     This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GCIDE, the
GNU version of the Collaborative International Dictionary of English,
formatted for use by The DICT Development Group's client sever software.

     The formatting software was written by Rickard E. Faith
(faith@acm.org).

     This package was constructed by Robert D. Hilliard
<hilliard@debian.org> from sources obtained from ftp.dict.org/pub/dict
(formatting software) and raw data files obtained privately from the
editor.  The GCIDE is archived on ftp.gnu.org, in the directory
/gnu/gcide, but this archive does not always contain the most recent
version.

Changes:
 * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
 * Modified webfilter.l and Makefile to handle modified tags.
