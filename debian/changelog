dict-web1913 (1.4-0.47pd-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Kirk Hilliard to scan.l and webfilter.l to eliminate
    many run-on entries.  Thanks, Kirk.
    Closes: #64808

dict-web1913 (1.4-0.47pd-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to Standards version 3.0.1.1:
    Modified for FHS - /usr/share{doc, man}
    Added scripts to provide and remove symlink  /usr/doc/dict-wn
    to /usr/share/doc/dict-wn and to reconfigure and restart dictd
    when this package is installed or removed.
    Corrected location of GPL license

  * Changed Recommends: to Suggests: due to the evil way dselect
    treats recomends.

  * Omitted from earlier changelog - patches for ../libmaa/hash.c and
    ../libmaa/decl.h were applied.  See dictd package for details of
    patches.   These patches are only needed to build the package for
    Sparc.  Since the package is architecture-all, the Sparc porters
    do not need to build the package under the current setup.

dict-web1913 (1.4-0.47pd-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Public Domain Version
  
  * Extracted dict-web1913-1.4.orig.tar.gz into the 
    dict-web1913-1.4_0.47pd/ directory; removed the database directory
    (web1913-0.46-a) and upacked the public domain version
    (web1913_0.47-pd.tar.gz) into web1913_0.47-pd/. Changed all file
    names in this directory from web_* to web1913.* to satisfy the
    Makefile.  Created dict-web1913_1.4_0.47pd.orig.tar.gz from this
    configuration.  Removed DOS newlines (^M) from databse files.

  * Modified Makefile.in as shown below for 1.4a-1.

  * Hacked webfilter.l to work with changed tags in the pd version.

  * Added a sed script in Makefile.in to modify the data stream input
    to webfilter to correct an error in representing the chemical
    formula for Carbonyl, which caused webfilter to break, and
    to remove the tag `&fist;'.

    dict-web1913-1.4; renamed dict-web1913-1.4 to dict-web1913-1.4a.
    Copied web1913-0.46-a.tar.gz (the database file) into this directory
    and unpacked it.  This is the configuration from which the package is
    built. Ran tar czf on dict-web1913-1.4a, to create
    dict-web1913_1.4a.orig.tar.gz  
  
  * Modified Makefile.in:
    Removed configure from the files removed by the distclean target in
    toplevel Makefile.in and in libmaa subdirectory.
    Commented out "install -m 755 -d $(dictdir)" since debian\rules makes
    this directory.
    Commented out "install-cide" from install: target and, $(CIDEBASE)
    $(CIDEINDEX): $(EXES) target
  
  * Removed two cide files from web1913-0.46-a/
