Message 84 in mail/dict-gcide 6/28/02:
     The new version of WordNet corrects a number of definitions of
geographic terms related to the Balkans.  (These corrections were
submitted by a Croatian Debian user.)  Some of these definitions were
included in the GCIDE supplements, and I suggest you correct them for
the next release of GCIDE.  The corrected definitions that were used
as supplements are:

  Croatia
       n : a republic in the western Balkans in south-central Europe
in
           the eastern Adriatic coastal area; formerly part of the
           Habsburg monarchy and Yugoslavia; became independent in
           1991 [syn: {Croatia}, {Republic of Croatia}, {Hrvatska}]

  Macedonia
       n 1: landlocked republic on the Balkan Peninsula; achieved
            independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 [syn: {Macedonia}]
       2: the ancient kingdom of Philip II and Alexander the Great in
          the southeastern Balkans that is now divided among modern
          Macedonia and Greece and Bulgaria [syn: {Macedon},
{Macedonia},
           {Makedonija}]

     Definitions that were corrected in WordNet, but that hadn't been
used in the supplementation, but that I suggest be added, are:

  Slovenia
       n : a mountainous republic in central Europe; formerly part of
           the Habsburg monarchy and Yugoslavia; achieved
           independence in 1991 [syn: {Slovenia}, {Republic of
           Slovenia}, {Slovenija}]

  Bosnia
       n : a mountainous republic of south-central Europe; formerly
           part of the Ottoman Empire and Yugoslavia; voted for
           independence in 1992 but the mostly Serbian army of
           Yugoslavia refused to accept the vote and began `ethnic
           cleansing' to rid Bosnia of Croats and Muslims [syn:
{Bosnia
           and Herzegovina}, {Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina},
{Bosna
           i Hercegovina}, {Bosnia-Herzegovina}, {Bosnia}]

  Adriatic
       n : an arm of the Mediterranean between Slovenia and Croatia
and
           Montenegro and Albania on the east and Italy on the west
           [syn: {Adriatic}, {Adriatic Sea}]

  Yugoslavia
       n : a mountainous republic in southeastern Europe [syn:
{Yugoslavia},
            {Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}, {Jugoslavija}, {Serbia
           and Montenegro}]

  Montenegro
       n : a former country bordering on the Adriatic Sea; now part of
           Yugoslavia [syn: {Montenegro}, {Crna Gora}]

     I have been putting off the geographical definitions -- I'd like
to get the CIA factbook data into a compressed format for this
purpose.
